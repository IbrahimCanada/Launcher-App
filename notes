TODO:

Q: Should snippet link be cryptaphied? Or should it be a subdomain? Or what?
	a. deal with what happens if a user signs in again before confiming. Repeat confirmation message? Deliver a new email?
2. Real site should pull api from my site to see if user is eligible. Or should there be a 'bouncer' widget?
3. Email confirmation for backend?
5. Have admin provide domain name he'll be using and incorporate that into the url for the users.
6. Email user when he is eligible.
7. Google analytics - I don't think this is applicable anymore.
